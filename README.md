This repo contains coding challenges form various companies I have interviewed with.  I also wrote the rspec tests for these challenges and hope that they will provide you with some help in regards to solving these challenges.  My solutions are attached in the folder named solutions, but please don't look at them unless you are really stuck.  If you guys have any questions or would like to provide some feedback, feel free to reach out.  I will also be updating this repo as I come accross more challenges.  Hope these challenges help you understand some new concepts, and please make sure to follow the detailed instructions inside each lib .rb file.  Thanks.
