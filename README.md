Easy set up instructions:

1.  cd in the directory where you want this repo to live.

2.  Clone the repo in that directory via copying and pasting the link below in:
    `$git@github.com:kparekh01/interview_challenges.git`
    
3.  Run bundle to install the rspec gem in the event you don't have it installed.
    `$bundle`
    
4.  Open up the folder, and go directly to the `/lib` file of the challenge you want to do, and follow instructions
    in the file.  

5.  In the future if you see more callenges on this repo(because I will be updating this repo with new challenges as they come     along), that do not exist in your folder, then simply cd in to this folder in the terminal and run this command:
    `$git pull origin master`
    
If you would like to see the tests written for that challenge go to the `spec/lib` and open up the 
file for the challenge you're working on.  Please do not open the solutions unless you are really stuck, they 
are there for reference only.  Any feedback you have , please feel free to reach out to me via our slack channel
I'm on the difference engine slack as @kparekh01.  Thanks and hope you learn some new concepts doing these challenges 
as I did.
