#Write a function which will take in an input of one number, and it will out put the
#the multiples of 13 in an array called unlucky
#the multiples of 7 in an array called lucky
#and the multiples of both 7 and 13 in an array called whoknows
#of all numbers between 1 and the input number
#make sure the function checks for input to be a number and that number
#has to be greater than 0
#out put should be in a hash which points to key value pairs
#example input method(20)
#example output {"lucky" => [7, 14], "unlucky" => [13], "whoknows" => []}
